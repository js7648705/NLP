# NLP
## Overview 
This is a natural language processing project, and data for this project is obtained from [Yelp Review Data Set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recsys-2013). We created the pipeline for workflow and tried different machine learning models such as  SGDClassifier, MultinomialNB, BernoulliNB, LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, and SVC. It turns out that "SGDClassifier" outperforms the other ML models and gives better performance in classifying the labels. For details refer to the Jupiter notebook -"NLP project".
